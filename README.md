**DESCRIPTION:**

The AutoNA addon is a tool that automates casting na spells / erase / healing waltz on party members and yourself when status ailments are detected.

**KNOWN ISSUES:**

Detection for when its safe to cast not always accurate. If spell interupted or cannot be cast, it will try again.

Under certain conditions, it may begin to have issues tracking which party members have status ailments correctly. For example party member 3 might have paralyze, but the addon will become certain its party member 5 for some reason. Potentially an issue with multiple instances of the addon running in multiple windows.

I am noticing this happening enough to say the addon is broken and should not be relied on.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

In the windower console;

lua l autona -- Loads the addon

lua u autona -- Unloads the addon

--   //autona on                -- Enable the addon to cast.
